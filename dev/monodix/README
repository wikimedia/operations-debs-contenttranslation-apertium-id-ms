This directory contains the necessary files needed to automatically generate linguistic data for Indonesian and Malay transducers (i.e. Apertium's .dix files).

== How to use ==
To generate Indonesian monolingual dictionary:
$ cat wordlist.id | sh create-monodix.sh id > ../../apertium-id-ms.id.dix

To generate Malaysian monolingual dictionary:
$ cat wordlist.ms | sh create-monodix.sh ms > ../../apertium-id-ms.ms.dix

== To add a new word ==
Create a new entry in manual.*.txt, and rerun the above commands.

== To add a new paradigm ==
Create a new entry in paradigms.txt, and rerun the above commands. Alternatively, add the new paradigm in header.txt.

== List of files ==
=== The scripts ===
* create-monodix.sh
Use this to generate the dictionary files.

* analyzer.py
A Python script that is used to generate an Apertium dictionary entry given a surface form. It makes use of KBBI dictionary from Kateglo to lemmatize and POS-tag the input, and hand-coded linguistic knowledge of the language to identify the morphemes. Finally it assigns a suitable paradigm and format the output to comply with the dictionary's format.

* paradigms-gen.py
Convert the data in paradigms.txt to XML.

* sort-dic.py
Organize dictionary entries according to paradigm names, sort words alphabetically.

* kateglo.py
Used to download the KBBI dictionary from http://kateglo.bahtera.org/.

=== The data ===
* kateglo.txt
This is the KBBI dictionary downloaded from http://kateglo.bahtera.org/.

* wordlist.id & wordlist.ms
Lists of words, sorted alphabetically, taken mainly from Wikipedia corpus.

* manual.id.txt & manual.ms.txt
Each contains a list of dictionary entries (words) that have been added manually.

* exceptions.txt
This file contains a list of words that have been excluded from the dictionary for some reasons (uncommon words, etc.).

* paradigms.txt
List of paradigms, in non-XML format.

* header.txt, middle.txt, footer.txt
